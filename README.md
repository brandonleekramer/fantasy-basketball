# NBA Fantasy Contract Value and League Projections

I have a vice... I love fantasy basketball. Over the past couple of years, I have been playing in a league with some friends, but after finishing grad school I have now expanded to four different leagues, including an "all-star" league where members of the league draft their team from the broader pool of NBA players based on existing contracts. Since seemingly everyone else in the league has participated in a draft like this before except for me, I decided to take an analytics-based approach to drafting my new team while also aggregating a broader database of all the contracts across my five leagues. After creating this database, I decided to cross reference the "value" of existing contracts against the performance of all NBA players in 2018 as well as the various projections that are released by fantasy basketball sites like Hashtag Basketball and another variation of those projections I acquired from a veteran in my league. I also decided that I would run overall team projections to see whether I stand a chance of winning the league or whether I should take an alternative strategy to build assets for the future (e.g. "tanking" to maximize the value of my own draft picks next season).

**Section 1.** Once I did this work, I decided to expand some of the fantasy tools for my other leagues as well. In each page, you will see five main sections. First, I load all of the projections statistics, contracts and team rosters for each league (Legacy Dynasty, Franchise NBA, NBA Best of the Best, and The Invitational. Each of these is a 30-team points leagues except for The Invitational, which is a 20-team nine categories league. For points leagues, this section converts raw nine-cat projections into points totals depending on the league's rules. For the cats leagues, it breaks the totals into those cats. In this section, you can look at the basic descriptives of team contracts and projections by team. 

**Section 2.** Second, there is a section where we look for value. For now, value is simply calculated as projected points totals
