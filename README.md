# NBA Fantasy Contract Value and League Projections

I have a vice... I love fantasy basketball! Over the past couple of years, I have been playing in a league with some friends, but after finishing grad school I have now expanded to five different leagues, including an "all-star" league where members of the league draft their team from the broader pool of NBA players based on existing contracts. Since seemingly everyone else in the league has participated in a draft like this before except for me, I decided to take an analytics-based approach to drafting my new team while also aggregating a broader database of all the contracts across my five leagues. 

After creating this database, I decided to cross reference the "value" of existing contracts against the performance of all NBA players in 2018 as well as the various projections that are released by fantasy basketball sites like Yahoo, ESPN, Hashtag Basketball and FB Ninja. I also decided that I would run overall team projections of each league to see whether I stand a chance of winning the league or whether I should take an alternative strategy to build assets for the future (e.g. tanking to maximize the value of my own draft picks next season).
