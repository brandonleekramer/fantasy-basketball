**New Value Calculations Based on Random Forests or newer ML technique**

Use RFs rather than LM like in the past 

**NBA Draft Projection Tools (Still in Development)** 

During the 2018-19 season, I also developed some basic descriptive analyses of NBA prospects. While this work deserves considerably more attention, I just did some basic graphing of box stats based on position type (categorized as guards, wings and bigs). These exercises helped me understand which prospects deserve to have more attention for watching tape. While I did use these tools to last year, I failed to take my results seriously enough and ignored indicators that said players like Tyler Herro, Matisse Thybulle and Brandon Clarke. Apparentely, there is something to be said for the power of these basic descriptive analsyses. That said, my strong preference would be to leverage some machine learning strategies on past prospect's college data to find out what the best statistics are the best indicators on NBA success for each position.

**Detecting Hot & Cold Streaks (Still in Development)** 

Draw from projections and the real-life NBA scheduling to develop an index for detecting "hot" and "cold" streaks. This effectively graphs players that are producting at above and/or below average totals.
